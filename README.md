# FireChat-MegaChat

The fire chat app is something  I decided to create after watching [Jeff Delaney's](https://angularfirebase.com/contributors/jeff-delaney/)
course on Angular and Firebase basics. Some challenges I faced with this project was modelling my data so I stored my messages correctly in Firestore.
This project really built a lot of my Angular 2+ knowledge.
